This is a classic game.
It was created during the process of studying GUI or game programming.
The original game is a game that is interpreted in your own way and made through some transformation process.

The rules of this game are as follows.
1. Press Space to start the game.  
2. You can move the main character with arrow keys and attack the enemy by pressing Z and X keys.  
3. At the same time as the game starts, the glow begins to grow.  
4. If the game is over when the glow is over, you will win the game if you earn 3000 points or more before that.  
(10 points for destroying enemy helicopters and turrets, 100 points for rescuing 1 person.)
